Kindly is a small library for defining in what kinds of ways things should be viewed.

It has been extracted out of [Notespace](github.com/scicloj/notespace) to allow for specifying such details across tools and libraries.

Nowadays, it is part of a stack of libraries organized around the [Clay](https://github.com/scicloj/clay) tool.

For documentation, please see [the Clay intro](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/#/notebooks/intro.clj).
